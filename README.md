## About
This is the home of the [Jink](https://github.com/jink-lang/jink) programming language. This is a WIP and any contributions are welcome. Read more in the [Contributing](#contributing) section below.

There is a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/cWzcQz2) that hosts the project where you can ask questions, get help, and chat with other contributors.

## Status
The project is in its very early stages and being actively developed. If you have familiarity with compilers and/or LLVM, your expertise would be greatly appreciated.

We have begun implementing the first stage compiler in Rust. The interpreter exists solely to mess about with the language and to test/simulate it. There are a number of issues and features that need to be addressed before we can move on to the next stage.

#### Goal Checklist / TODOs

The lexer and parser are now up to snuff with and surpass the original interpreted implementation. Here are a list of goals that scope out the new project and repository, not in or by any particular order or specification.

##### General
- [ ] Design standard for modules
- [ ] Build standard library
- [ ] Start writing self-hosted compiler
- [ ] Add examples
- [ ] Add documentation / tutorials
- [ ] Add issue templates
- [ ] Add pull request templates
##### Compiler
- [ ] Standardize type inference
- [ ] Fix nested conditionals
- [ ] Add structs/types
- [ ] Add while loops
- [ ] Write compiler tests
##### Lexer
- [ ] Lex string templates
##### Parser
- [x] Parse type definitions
- [x] Parse objects
- [x] Parse arrays
- [x] Parse classes
- [ ] Parse self keyword in classes
- [ ] Parse self keyword in methods
- [x] Parse module imports
- [ ] Parse string templates
- [ ] Parse pub keyword on definitions
- [ ] Parse indexing (arrays)
- [ ] Parse indexing (object properties and methods)
- [ ] Parse del statements
- [ ] Parse while loops
- [ ] Parse for loops
- [ ] Parse public statements
- [ ] Parse external statements

## Examples

##### Hello World
```js
print("Hello, World!"); // Hello, World!
```

##### Variables
```js
const name = "Jacob";
let age;
age = 1 + 100 / 4;

print(name); // Jacob
print(age); // 26
```

##### Functions
```js
// Inline
fun inline(let abc) return abc;
fun inline_newline(let def)
  return def;

// Typed params & return types
fun add(int a, int b) -> int {
  return a + b;
}

// Recursion (Fibonacci sequencer)
fun fib(let number) {
  if (number <= 1) return number
  return fib(number - 2) + fib(number - 1)
}

print(fib(10)) // 55

// Dynamic defaults
fun test(let a: 5) {
  print(a);
}

test() // 5
```

##### Modules
```js
import module
import module as hi
import module.*
import module.abc.*
import module.abc.def
import module.abc.def as xyz
import from module.abc { def as xyz, mno, ghi as jkl }
import from module.abc.def {
  ghi as jkl,
  mno,
  pqr as stu
}
```

##### Classes
```js
type address = {
  street: string,
  city: string,
  state: string,
  zip: int
};

pub cls Business = {
  fun new(string name, address addr) -> self {
    self.name = name;
    self.address = addr;
  };

  pub fun get_address() -> address {
    return self.address;
  };
};

const business = Business("Jink", {
  street: "1234 Jink St.",
  city: "Jinkville",
  state: "Jinkland",
  zip: 12345
});

print(business.get_address().city); // Jinkville
```

## Installation

### Prerequisites

You will need to have Rust installed on your machine. You can follow the instructions on the [Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to install it.

You will also need LLVM 16.0.0 installed on your machine. You can follow the instructions on the [LLVM website](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html) to install it.

### Running

To run the project, you can run the following command:

```bash
cargo run ./path/to/file.jk
```

To run the compiler in verbose mode, you can run the following command:

```bash
cargo run ./path/to/file.jk -v
```

This will help you see the output of the parser and IR builder and debug any issues you may have.

To run the interpreter, you can run the following command:

```bash
cargo run ./path/to/file.jk -i
```
