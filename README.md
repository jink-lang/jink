## About
Jink is a functional, object-oriented programming language designed with programmer familiarity in mind. Inspired by JavaScript, C++, Python and Go, Jink aims to offer a streamlined, modern and flexible but familiar syntax with enough power behind it to leave more room and time for actually writing good software.

This is a WIP and any contributions are welcome. Read more in the [Contributing](#contributing) section below. <!-- To read on the current state of the language, visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/jink-lang/jink/wiki). -->

There is a [Discord](https://discord.gg/cWzcQz2) server that hosts the project where you can ask questions, get help, and chat with other contributors. And [another](https://discord.gg/hUhDG8cfF9) broader community from contributors to this project where we chat about projects in general. Jink repo updates are posted in both.

## Status
Jink is in its early stages and being actively developed. If you have familiarity with compilers and/or LLVM, your expertise would be greatly appreciated.

We have begun implementing the first stage compiler in Rust. There are a number of issues and features that need to be addressed before we can move on to the next stage.

#### Goal Checklist / TODOs

Here are a list of goals that scope out the Jink project and repository, not in or by any particular order or specification.

If you are interested in and new to contributing to the project, TODOs here marked with an `N` are good newcomer starting points that would not be as difficult to implement and would help you get acquainted with the codebase.

- [ ] Parse for loops with different assignment types (`N`)

## Examples

##### Hello World
```js
print("Hello, World!"); // Hello, World!
```

##### Variables
```js
const name = "Jacob";
let age;
age = 1 + 100 / 4;

print(name); // Jacob
print(age); // 26
```

##### Functions
```js
// Inline
fun inline(let abc) return abc;
fun inline_newline(let def)
  return def;

// Typed params & return types
fun add(int a, int b) -> int {
  return a + b;
}

// Recursion (Fibonacci sequencer)
fun fib(let number) {
  if (number <= 1) return number
  return fib(number - 2) + fib(number - 1)
}

print(fib(10)) // 55

// Dynamic defaults
fun test(let a: 5) {
  print(a);
}

test() // 5
```

##### Modules
```js
import module
import module as hi
import module.*
import module.abc.*
import module.abc.def
import module.abc.def as xyz
import from module.abc { def as xyz, mno, ghi as jkl }
import from module.abc.def {
  ghi as jkl,
  mno,
  pqr as stu
}
```

##### Classes
```js
type address = {
  street: string,
  city: string,
  state: string,
  zip: int
};

pub cls Business = {
  fun new(string name, address addr) -> self {
    self.name = name;
    self.address = addr;
  };

  pub fun get_address() -> address {
    return self.address;
  };
};

const business = Business("Jink", {
  street: "1234 Jink St.",
  city: "Jinkville",
  state: "Jinkland",
  zip: 12345
});

print(business.get_address().city); // Jinkville
```

## Installation

### Prerequisites

You will need to have Rust installed on your machine. You can follow the instructions on the [Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to install it.

You will also need (at least) LLVM 16.0.0 installed on your machine. You can follow the instructions on the [LLVM website](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html) to install it.

### Running

To run the project, you can run the following command:

```bash
cargo run ./path/to/file.jk
```

To run the compiler in verbose mode, you can run the following command:

```bash
cargo run ./path/to/file.jk -v
```

This will help you see the output of the parser and IR builder and debug any issues you may have.

To run the interpreter, you can run the following command:

```bash
cargo run ./path/to/file.jk -i
```
